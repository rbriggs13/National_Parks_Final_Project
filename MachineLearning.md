# Machine Learning

A merged file was pulled from PostgresSQL and was used for Machine Learning. We first preprocessed our data with Jupyter Notebook to remove unecessary columns and rows that did not have enough information. This data was then sent to PostgreSQL dor tata storage. Our Machine Learning was done in Jupyter Notebook. We connected to our database to pull our data. This data was preprocessed, before test and train data was produced. We used the Random Forest Model. We also passed our trained and test data through a deep neural network. Our results was pretty accurate.

# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis

We user Jupyter Notebook to clean our data. After data was cleaned to remobe the irrevalant columns, we passed our data to PostgreSQL for storage and further manipulation.


## Database Storage

PostgresSQL is the database we used to merge tables. These we then used for our Machine Learning component.

## Machine Learning

SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is based on Deep Forest and Deep Neural Network. We utalised one-hot encoding and create train and test data. We created a random forect classifier, evaluate and fit the model.

## Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we integrate D3.js with PyPlot for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. Our interactive dashboard display charts of our findings with regards to the bioactivity in the US national Parks.

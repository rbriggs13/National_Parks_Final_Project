# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis

We user Jupyter Notebook to clean our data. 
P

## Database Storage
PostgresSQL is the database we used to merge tables. These we then used for our Machine Learning component.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is based on Deep Forest and Deep Neural Network. We utalised one-hot encoding and create train and test data. We created a random forect classifier, evaluate and fit the model.

## Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js with PyPlot for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard.
